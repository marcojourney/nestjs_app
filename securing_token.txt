No, token-based authentication does not store tokens in the database. The token is typically generated by the server and is passed to the client in the response to a login request. The client then stores the token and sends it with subsequent requests to the server. The server can then use the token to authenticate the user.

Storing tokens in the database would make them vulnerable to attack. If an attacker were to gain access to the database, they would be able to steal the tokens and use them to impersonate users.

Instead, tokens are typically stored in a secure location, such as the user's browser or a hardware token. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to steal or tamper with the tokens.

Here are some of the reasons why tokens are not stored in the database:

* **Security:** Storing tokens in the database would make them vulnerable to attack. If an attacker were to gain access to the database, they would be able to steal the tokens and use them to impersonate users.
* **Scalability:** Storing tokens in the database can be a scalability bottleneck. If there are a large number of users, the database can become overloaded.
* **Performance:** Storing tokens in the database can impact performance. The database needs to be queried every time a token is needed to authenticate a user.

Overall, storing tokens in the database is not a good practice. It is more secure and scalable to store tokens in a secure location, such as the user's browser or a hardware token.
